The

[mugen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mugen_(game_engine))

is an engine for creating fighting games, which you can modify any way you like.

look at the link above for more information.

used the

[mugen1.1beta](https://mugen.br.uptodown.com/windows)

for game creation, as it is the most unstable to move and modify.

# characters added / added.


I got the characters from the site [mugen archive](https://mugenarchive.com/)

which has a large collection of characters, not even being able to count them.

# modifications


the only thing I've changed is the characters' sounds, as they are so loud.

for that I used the

[fighterfactory, (virtual fighterfactory studio)](http://fighterfactory.virtualltek.com/download)

an editor for fighting games, including mugen.

surprisingly, it is accessible with NVDA from install to use.

of course, for graphical operations, it will be inaccessible like extracting sprite, as this needs visual help or even tinkering with animations.

as we are just moving the file (.snd) or sound file. the process is very simple.

# songs / sounds


I used songs like for the game's splash screen, verse screen, and stages.

the songs can be found at (c:\\users\\your-user\\downloads\\eterna-legend-da-moon\\eterna-legend da lua, immortal clash!\\sound)

# game information and download


there are characters from snk / other games . : they are all girls, don't be surprised about that ok? haha ha.

all of them as said were removed from the mugen archive site, but who modified the sounds was me.

the game keys are pretty simple though... I've mapped it so it's easier for users to play games so their hands won't hurt easily.

* up arrow. (move to an item above in the menu)
* down arrow, (moves down to an option in the menu)
* enter, (enter a selected option
* a, (weak punch).
*s, (medium punch).
* d, (could be a strong punch / something else, it depends on the character
* z, (weak kick)
* x, (medium kick)
* c, (hard kick).
* esc, go back to the menu if you are in a fight. or exits a menu / something else. back key.

remembering that the things a character does with these keys can change, as each character has something different.

in the end I hope you like it.

# game menus


* (Arcade mode) When you enter the game, you will already be focused on this option).
* (second option, verse mode).
* (third option, training mode).
* (fourth option, pc vs pc mode).
* (and fifth option, settings).

when choosing a character to fight, they are in a row from right to left, up and down. that is! in character selection screen you can use left or right arrow keys to navigate.

can use (z) to enter options / select characters.

in training mode, first select your character then the opposing character.

# system requirements


operating system: (OS) windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10.

Processor: 1ghz.

memory: 512mb of ram

graphics card required: built-in or dedicated, \*no difference)

disk space required: 374mb

# characters existing in the game


as I update the game, new characters will come! however I have to modify the sounds / sounds. so getting new characters can take a while.
