More than just a game, Lost in Blindness offers an extraordinary experience!

Play as Alex, a young blind archaeologist and follow in the footsteps of the disappearance of the Mayan civilization!

In Lost in Blindness, the blindfolded adventure game, discover amazing 3D environments with only sound, seeing nothing and totally free to move.

Explore a temple deep in the Amazon and solve all the puzzles it contains.
Thanks to a system of dialogue options, make decisions that will change the course of your story, to make it even more forceful!

And because an adventure game worthy of the name always has its share of action and infiltration, be careful to be aware, it seems that some people and creatures really don't want you to discover the secrets of the temple!
But don't worry, you'll also find precious allies... at least... maybe.

Lost in Blindness is the promise of a game like you've never seen it before!
So… Ready for the LOST IN BLINDNESS adventure?

description

Race Together is the racing app inspired by the race "Run with me" ("Run together"). The player's task is to listen to the car stereo ahead to control his car. There are many other vehicles on the road, so the car running ahead always has to dodge to avoid them. If you don't control it in time, you will be stabbed in these vehicles. The faster you go, the faster you have to think. Depending on the distance covered, you will receive gold, silver, bronze or platinum medals. This game is designed to work even when TalkBack is turned on and has a nice graphical interface. So if you don't know how to play, ask someone to guide you. This first version has 3 tracks. Game Instructions: 1. This game is played in landscape mode and must have a stereo headphone to play. 2. Before starting to play, you must verify that you have correctly installed the right headphones by pressing the headphone button. 3. Click Start playing button to play. 4. Control the car with the left and right buttons at the bottom of the screen (1/3 and half of the screen). On the left there are 7 buttons left and right with 7 buttons on the right. You control the car with your fingers on the buttons. Note that you do not hold your hands on these buttons, but raise your hands when control is complete. 5. You hear the sound of the car ahead and distinguish the left or right of your vehicle and quickly steer your car towards the vehicle in front. 6. The game ends when your car hits the car on the road. Operating Instructions: 1. You support the device horizontally with 2 pointers, the screen is facing up. Two thumbs are available above the two corners of the screen. 2. What you need to do is steer your car in the right direction. When you hear the car stereo coming to the right, grab your right thumb to move left to right in the right corner of the screen to steer your car to the right. With the sound on the left, do the same with your left finger. The goal is for the engine sound of the car in front to be in the middle. 3. Watch only the touch and not very fast, but TalkBack receives the horizontal gesture from TalkBack. After scratching, remove your finger from the screen and get ready for the next move.

Rock-paper-scissors is a classic game that everyone knows. Rock-paper-scissors is not just a game of chance, but a strategic system with a strong psychological foundation. It is often used as a method of fair choice between two people, similar to flipping a coin, drawing picks, or rolling dice to resolve a dispute or make an impartial group decision. Unlike truly random selection methods, however, rock paper scissors can be played with a certain degree of skill, recognizing and exploiting non-random behavior in opponents. Can you explore your opponent's behavior? There's only one way to find out! Rock Paper Scissors Online supports two modes: - Practice mode: you play offline against your device. - Play online mode: you play against real humans. To play in this mode, you must log into Google. You can invite your friends to play, accept invites from friends or just quickly play with unknown users. Additional features: - Players can send a laugh and cry to the opponent to show their attitude towards the game. - Score can only be reset by agreement.
